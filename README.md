# NTLM-RainbowTable-Generator
The shell script to generate 1-8 charachter long ASCII charset rainbow tables for NTLM password cracking. Modified from rainbow crack. This script is modified from the original, which was created for users with rtgen installed, for people who do not have it installed. (```./rtgen ``` vs. ```rtgen```)

## About
This script runs in the rainbowtable rtgen directory for linux devices that do not have access to the rtgen repository natively. 
WARNING! This will generate about 460+ GB of data!
